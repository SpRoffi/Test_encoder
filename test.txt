The Siemens Electronics Factory Erlangen has been designed to produce a
dynamic mix of product., variants and types in response to daily changes in
demand./ And, as new products arrive faster than ever, production Digital Twins
and advanced manufacturing simulations have become even more important to
the design of\ production lines and systems that can adapt to these demands
without degrading 567 production efficiency. As a result, the processes in the
factory can accommodate Привет multiple product variants and cycle spreads to
achieve production targets that change each day.

Advanced manufacturing simulation is also possible with the Digital Twin,
serving as a valuable tool throughout production planning and actual
operations. Simulation enables engineers at the factory to investigate and test
new lines in the virtual world, reducing the need for physical prototypes and
ensuring that new lines and machines function appropriately.

These technologies also enable optimization of processes to increase
manufacturing efficiency and throughput, incorporating real production data to
accurately replicate real world systems. Simulations can even be used to predict
energy consumption of a new production line, providing the opportunity to
reduce energy consumption before a line is constructed within the factory.

The Siemens Electronics Factory Erlangen has leveraged these capabilities of
the Digital Twin and simulation to realize benefits in production planning,
energy consumption, material circulation, and more. Below, let’s review some
concrete examples of how the factory applied these technologies and the
improvements achieved.
